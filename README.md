# Responsive Static Resume Website

This project is a responsive resume page showcasing my portfolio, skills, and certifications. It is built with React.js and styled using TailwindCSS. A unique feature of this resume page is a visitor counter, which is powered by a Lambda function in a Python backend. The application is hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via CloudFront, with domain management handled through Route 53.
